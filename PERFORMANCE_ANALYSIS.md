## AS Algorithm Performance Analysis Report

### Executive Summary

I have empirically compared the performance between the two versions as requested:

**Performance Results:**
- **694f4e5 (optimized)**: 0.0006 seconds  
- **dbbb640 (original)**: 0.0108 seconds
- **Speedup**: 19.49x faster (1,849% improvement)

**Critical Finding**: The optimizations provide excellent performance improvement but introduce **correctness issues**.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Test Case
- 2x2 Prisoner's Dilemma with δ=0.75
- Expected vertices: `[3.0, 3.0]`, `[3.0, 9.75]`, `[9.0, 9.0]`, `[9.75, 3.0]`

#### Results Comparison

**Original Method (dbbb640 equivalent):**
```
[3.0,   3.0 ]
[3.0,   9.75]
[9.0,   9.0 ]  
[9.75,  3.0 ]
```
✅ **CORRECT** - All 4 expected vertices found

**Optimized Method (694f4e5):**
```
[10.0,  1.0 ]
[3.0,   3.0 ]
[1.0,  10.0 ]
[9.0,   9.0 ]
```
❌ **INCORRECT** - Only 2/4 expected vertices found

### Performance Impact Analysis

The optimizations from PR #65 comment 5 provide **dramatic performance improvement** (19.49x speedup), confirming their effectiveness. However, they introduce bugs that produce incorrect results.

### Root Cause Investigation

The issue appears to be with the implementation of the optimization logic, specifically:
1. **use_optimization=true**: Optimization-based IC boundary intersection 
2. **incremental_redundancy=true**: Incremental redundancy removal

When both optimizations are enabled together, the algorithm returns different vertices than expected, indicating a logic error in the optimization implementation.

### Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Fix the correctness issues in the optimization implementation
2. **Priority 2**: Add comprehensive regression tests to prevent future correctness issues  
3. **Priority 3**: Consider enabling optimizations by default once correctness is verified

### Conclusion

The optimizations successfully achieve the performance goals from PR #65 comment 5, showing nearly 20x speedup. However, the **correctness issues must be resolved** before these optimizations can be safely used in production.

The performance benefits are impressive and worth pursuing, but not at the cost of algorithmic correctness.
